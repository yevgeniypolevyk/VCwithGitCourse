This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
This is for the ones who stood their ground
It's for Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't enough, you've got to make your own breaks
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
You better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
